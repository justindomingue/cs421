## Few facts:

* **Attributes in none of the FDs** => in every key : *none*

* **RH side but never in LH side of an FD** => never in a key : TC

* **LH side but never in RH side of an FD** => in every key : ARNS

* **Both LH and RH side of an FD** => cannot say anything : B

## Finding the keys

* **Core** (attributes that must be in every key) : ARNS
* **Closure of the core** (attributes determined by the core) : ARNSBCT

Since all the attributes are in the closure of the core, the core is not only a key, it is also the *only key*
