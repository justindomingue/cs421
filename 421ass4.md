## Question 1

### Part a

#### Diagram

insert!!!!

#### Schema

**Entities**

Customer(*cid*, cname, billing_address, shipping_address)
Books(*isbn*, title, author, price, qty_stock)
Orders(*oid*, qty, order_date, ship_date, status)
Publisher(*pid*, pname, phone_number, address)

cid -> cname,billing_address,shipping_address
isbn -> title,author,price,qty_stock
oid -> qty,order_date,ship_date,status
pid -> pname,phone_number,address

**Weak entities**

Reviews(*isbn*, *cid*, text, rating, date)
Discounts(*amount*, *isbn*, until)
FeaturedBooks(*isbn*, until)

**Relationships**

Ordered(*oid*, *cid*, *isbn*)
Wants(*cid*, *isbn*, since)
RecentlyViewed(*cid*, *isbn*, *date*)
Publishes(*pid*, *isbn*, year)

### Part d

In this project, we developed and built a datbase application for an online book store. In the first phase, we chose the application domain  and designed the database. We performed a requirement analysis for the appliation as well as an entity-relationship schema (E/R) for the data described in the data analysis and  finally translated it into a relational model. We have learned to properly formulate the requirements of a real-world application as well as translate those requirements into a formal language. In the second phase, we created the database using DB2/PostgreSQL, populated it with realistic data and  maintained, queried and updated the data. We learned to write SQL statements and execute them in the DB2/PostgreSQL environments. In the third step, we did some programming in the database (triggers and stored procedures) as well as building a "user-friendly", interactive applicatin program front end using Java and the JDBC driver. We learned more about database programming and automation and how to connect and query/update a DB2/PostgreSQL database from within Java.

If the project was to be redone, we would do a few things differently. First, we would use the same database management system throughout the project. In fact, we used DB2 in the first milestone and PostgeSQL afterwards. Although it allowed us to get acquainted with the different ecosystems, it lead to some inconsistencies between different parts of the project and we wasted some time trying to unify all the work.

## Question 2

### Part a

#### Few facts:

* **Attributes in none of the FDs** => in every key : *none*

* **RH side but never in LH side of an FD** => never in a key : TC

* **LH side but never in RH side of an FD** => in every key : ARNS

* **Both LH and RH side of an FD** => cannot say anything : B


#### Finding the keys

* **Core** (attributes that must be in every key) : ARNS
* **Closure of the core** (attributes determined by the core) : ARNSBCT

Since all the attributes are in the closure of the core, the core is not only a key, it is also the *only key*
